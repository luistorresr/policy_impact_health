# The impact of regulation on employee well-being: An analysis of 35 European Countries. 

The aim of this study is to explore whether the introduction of specific legislation on psychosocial risks and/or work-related stress is related to having an action plan to prevent work-related stress, and in turn, better psychosocial working conditions (job demands and resources), and less reported work-related stress in the workforce.

It does so by comparing EU member states and candidate countries that have introduced more specific legislation to those that have not and by conducting multilevel modelling analysis linking two representative European-level datasets, the 2014 employer European Survey of Enterprises on New & Emerging Risks (ESENER) and the 2015 employee European Working Conditions Survey (EWCS).
